# Andrea Barberio

Hello stranger, welcome to my GitHub home.

My name is Andrea Barberio, and I work as Production Engineer in Meta (f.k.a. Facebook).
I work in the Web Foundation team, focusing on the company-wide incident response and web
infrastructure development. I used to work on open source firmware and hardware, bricking
anything that was in sight.
In my personal time I enjoy programming, reverse engineering, and photography.

My personal home page has more information about me, go there if you're curious, https://insomniac.slackware.it ,
or take a peek at [my r&eacute;sum&eacute;](https://insomniac.slackware.it/static/resume_barberio.pdf)
or [my LinkedIn profile](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/barberio).

You can also drop me [an email](https://insomniac.slackware.it/pages/email)

## Some projects I work on:
* **Dublin Traceroute**, a tool for mapping and visualizing multipath networks using ECMP-aware traceroute. Based on the ideas from Paris Traceroute's research, it adds a few things on top. See https://dublin-traceroute.net and https://blog.dublin-traceroute.net
* the **Go DHCP (v6 and v4) library**, widely used in small and large scale infrastructures, see https://github.com/insomniacslk/dhcp
* **CoreDHCP**, a modular DHCPv6/v4 server based on the above library, see https://coredhcp.io
* **Open System Firmware**, sometimes referred to as **LinuxBoot**, an open source alternative to existing system firmware (like UEFI) that uses Linux and a Go userland and bootloaders. OSF is made by several components, like coreboot, Linux, u-root. See the [LinuxBoot book](https://github.com/linuxboot/book) and https://linuxboot.org for a more detailed overview
* **Systemboot*, a LinuxBoot distribution for bootloaders based on [u-root](github.com/u-root/u-root) to implement boot from network and from local storage for LinuxBoot. Now merged in the [u-root](https://github.com/u-root/u-root) project. See https://systemboot.org
* **irc-slack**, an IRC-to-Slack gateway that lets me chat with a lot of people with a few MBs of RAM, have my own client and custom notifications, unlimited logging, and much more. See https://github.com/insomniacslk/irc-slack
